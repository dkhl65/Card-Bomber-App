# Card-Bomber-App

Android app developing with Android Studio is a personal project that I did in the summer break of 2018. Android uses XML for the layout and Java for the program. This app is the mobile version of the Card Bomber game which I made in grade 11 (https://github.com/dkhl65/Card-Bomber-App). It has support for three languages. The APK file can be installed onto an Android device, located in CardBomber/app/release/app-release.apk
